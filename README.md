# Sepsis_Prediction

## **Objective:** 

Developed a predictive model to detect sepsis early using patient physiological data.

## **Data Preprocessing:**

Handled missing values and outliers in time-series medical data.

Engineered features from patient vital signs and laboratory test results.

## **Model Training:**

Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).

Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

## **Model Evaluation:**

Assessed model performance using AUC-ROC, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Improved early sepsis detection for timely medical intervention.

## **Tech Stack:** 

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
